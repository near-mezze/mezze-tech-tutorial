# ![NEAR](https://github.com/humanman/near-sample-thanks-tutorial/blob/master/src/assets/img/logo_near_bright.svg)

This is my base application for creating rich tutorials focused on blockchain development. 

Currently, I am working on a tutorial for writing Smart Contracts on the NEAR protocol. Once completed, I will start a growing list of tutorial microsites built with this theme. 

I hope to see you back!
